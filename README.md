This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### `Building a Discord Clone Using MERN stack`

-> In this project, I am using the React Redux for developing the Discord.<br />
-> For the Front-end part, I'm using React Js for building the functional components for Sidebar, Chat Header, Chat body, Chat Input sections.<br />
-> And for the Icons I'm using the Material UI Icons.<br />
-> Then for the Back-end part, initially using the Firebase for Authenticating and for cloud storage.<br />
-> Then later using the Node Js including the powerful ExpressJs and serverless database MongoDb.

### `Steps for building Discord (front-end)`

1. Set-up the React Environment using the below commands.
2. Building the Sidebar.
3. Building the Chat section.
4. Configuring the Firebase for Authentication and for cloud storage.
5. After completing the development, deploy it in the Firebase.
6. Then implementing the Back-end using the Node js with Express js and MongoDB.
7. Hosing the backend(Node js) in Heroku and host entire project in firebase hosing.

### `Steps for building Discord (back-end)`

1. Setup the Node envirorment and install all the required packages require such as Express, MongoDB, Nodemon so on..
2. Declare the config files which is required for the project.
3. Call the middleware for the authentication.
4. Connect to the DB with the database configuration and create a separate page for the Schema models in DB Collections.
5. Then call the API with the Push,Get,Put and other crud functionality calls with the help of POSTMAN.
6. Create a separate API for creating the Channels and to send the message with respect to the channel.
7. Then with the help of the PUSHER creating the Real Time Database envirorment with the MongoDB.
8. Then with the HELp of the Axios displaying to the front end screen with the help of the PUSHER.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
